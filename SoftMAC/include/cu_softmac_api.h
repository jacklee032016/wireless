 *
 * SoftMAC is an abstraction designed to facilitate the creation
 * of custom and experimental MAC layers when used with Software
 * Defined Radio hardware. A traditional network interface system
 * is structured with a tightly coupled MAC and PHY layer exporting
 * a standard API to the operating system.

 *
 * This structure permits the easy swapping of underlying network
 * hardware. Two different brands of ethernet card will both show up
 * as eth0 on a system, and as long as the drivers and hardware
 * both function properly an application doesn't have to concern
 * itself with which network card is being used.
 *

 *
 * The SoftMAC breaks out the integrated MAC and PHY layer
 * into separate (but still coupled) components.

 * 
 * This structure affords even greater flexibility than the traditional
 * network stack when used with appropriately capable hardware. Most MAC
 * layers are still implemented either wholly or partially by the underlying
 * hardware and are immutable. With such hardware the SoftMAC abstraction
 * makes no sense, and serves only as an extra layer of inefficiency.
 * However, recent advances in <i>Software Defined Radio</i> technology
 * have resulted in much more flexible network hardware. Fully exploiting
 * the capabilities of this hardware requires a more flexible network
 * stack. SoftMAC is designed to strike a balance between flexibility
 * and efficiency that will permit experimentation with this hardware.
