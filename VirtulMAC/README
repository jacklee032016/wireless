This file describes the basics of Softmac.  This document assumes the reader 
is familiar with networking concepts, configuring wireless networking in Linux,
and the madwifi driver.

Softmac is an extension to the Madwifi [http://madwifi.sourceforge.org] driver
for the Atheros 802.11a/b/g networking cards that provides more control over
the MAC layer. In particular, Softmac lets you control

* The transmitted contents of any given frame, aside from three mandatory 
  bytes in the header and an automatically appended checksum
* The receiption of packets, including those that fail to pass the checksum
* The timing of when packets are transmitted 

This allows researchers to build new mac protocols using relatively 
inexpensive networking hardware.

Installing Softmac

For install instructions, see the INSTALL file included with the softmac 
source code.  The latest version of INSTALL can be found at:

Running SoftMAC
---------------

The easiest way to get Softmac up and running is to use the 
'load_softmac_base.sh' script found in the scripts directory of the
Softmac SVN repository.  This script takes care of loading the required
kernel modules and getting the Softmac phy layer up and running.

Steps 1-3 below are provided by the 'load_softmac_base.sh' script.

1) First load the Softmac version of the Madwifi driver.  Stopping here, one
   would have the same functionality as the stock Madwifi driver.  In general,
   Softmac operates with the card in monitor mode.

  # /sbin/modprobe ath_pci
  # /sbin/ifconfig ath0 up
  # /sbin/iwconfig ath0 mode monitor

2) The Softmac version of the Madwifi driver provides a low level interface 
   to the physical wireless device.  Softmac calls this interface 'athphy'.  
   athphy is a Softmac PHY layer.  We must tell Softmac to create an instance
   of athphy.  Most Softmac configuration is done through the /proc filesystem.

  # echo athphy > /proc/softmac/create_instance

   The instance of athphy just created will be called 'athphy0'.  Instances
   of Softmac layers (MAC or PHY) typically store configuration information
   in /proc/softmac/insts/<instance name>.  

3) We're almost running Softmac.  All that remains is to tell athphy that we
   want to run as Softmac instead of using the stock Madwifi functionality.

  # echo 1 > /proc/softmac/insts/athphy0/softmac_enable

4) Now we need an instance of a MAC layer.  This example will use the 
   'cheesymac' MAC layer.

  # /sbin/modprobe softmac_cheesymac
  # echo cheesymac > /proc/softmac/create_instance

   This creates an instance of cheesymac that is probably called 'cheesy1'.
   MAC layers will typically provide their own network interface that is used 
   in place of the standard 'ath0' interface.  Usually the interface will have
   the same name as the MAC Layer instance.  Configure the network interface.

  # /sbin/ifconfig cheesy1 192.168.1.2

5) Connect the MAC layer to the PHY layer and you're done!

  # echo cheesy1 > /proc/softmac/insts/athphy0/mac_layer
