Linux RadioTap
--------------
These patches add RadioTap support to the Linux IEEE80211 stack.

RadioTap was first developed on NetBSD and provides a common signal layer for
all the different wireless drivers.  It's extendable and cross-platform.

At the moment this code assumes we will be assigned ARPHRD 803 for radiotap.

RadioTap
--------
Radiotap is a standard header format for signal layer information from wireless
cards (similar to the Wlan-NG Prism and AVS header formats).  It is used on
Net, Free, and OpenBSD to carry information.

The radiotap headers consist of a bitfield of included fields, and the field
data itself.  It contains the expected antenna, signal, noise, channel,
and MAC timing fields, as well as a set of flags to indicate appended FCS
bytes and other fields.

Why?
----
Linux is finally getting a unified 802.11 stack.  I'd like to see this done
right, so that we have a standard format for getting data from cards that
provides all the information we need.  One option is to expand the AVS headers,
however they are not without their limitations.  By adding radiotap support,
we come in line with other systems providing info and we allow the same 
dissection code to work in userspace across multiple operating systems.
Besides, if a standard already exists with all the components we need, does
inventing a new one make sense?
